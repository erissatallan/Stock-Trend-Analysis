# Stock-Trend-Analysis
 Statistical analyses of the price movements of the most profitable stock indices of 2023 and the five years leading up to 2024.

## Algorithm 1
The SPY is an exchange-traded fund (ETF) that tracks the S&P 500 ETF. The algorithm SPY500 above trades this ETF by buying or selling 10% of the portolio in response to the corresponding market movement. A business-week period between the close of a trade to the opening of another is given to not enter a trade in the same conditions just left.

## Algorithm 2
Buy and hold a stock or Exchange Traded Fund (ETF) with a stop loss executed when the stock drops to 5% below its present price. If the stop loss is hit, exit the position then resume trading after a business-week. The one week wait is time given for the instrument to step out of the prevailing market trend.
